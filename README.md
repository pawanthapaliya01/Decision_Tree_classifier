# Decision_Tree_classifier
In this code:

    We import the necessary libraries, including NumPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn.
    We load the Iris dataset, which is a built-in dataset in scikit-learn. You can replace it with your own dataset.
    The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
    A decision tree classifier is created using DecisionTreeClassifier from scikit-learn.
    The model is trained on the training data using fit.
    We make predictions on the test data using predict.
    Model performance is evaluated with accuracy, a confusion matrix, and a classification report.
    We plot the decision tree using plot_tree to visualize the learned decision rules.
